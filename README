Alien::Base will be a base class to help build Alien:: modules for simple libraries.

Initially the target will be Alien::GSL (and probably other Gnu libraries) but in principle there is no limitation.

Special thanks go out to:

- Christian Walde (Mithaldu) for productive conversations about component interoperablility,
- kmx for writing Alien::Tidyp from which I drew many of my initial ideas,
- David Mertens (run4flat) for productive conversations about implementation,
- Mark Nunberg (mordy, mnunberg) for graciously teaching me about rpath and dynamic loading,
